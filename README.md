# VS OVERLAY
VS Overlay for MIUI is an initiative aimed at providing comprehensive and accurate translations for MIUI versions, a user interface for Android devices developed by Xiaomi.

Our project focuses on translating text strings from Chinese into various languages such as English, Vietnamese, French, German, and many others. We use translation methods along with translation tools to ensure that our translations are accurate and easily understandable.

If you would like to contribute to our project, you can do so by translating text strings from Chinese into a language you know or editing existing translations to enhance their quality.

We hope that this project will help MIUI users have a better experience when using their interface on Android devices.

Thank you for joining our project, and if you have any questions or contributions, please feel free to contact us.
